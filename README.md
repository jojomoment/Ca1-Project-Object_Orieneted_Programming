# Ca1-Project-Object_Orieneted_Programming

for our project we  are making a player leaderboard  system that will rank players based off of their performance, the system will be  based off  a single entity called playerData, this will make it easy to search   for data by score, win rate or date among other factors like losses.

each playerData entity will include the players ID number,player name, score, level, wins, losses, date, and a calculated win rate (wins divded by total games played). The leaderboard will initially be sorted by score (highest first), then level, then most recent date, lastly by alphabetical order of players names.

The system supports three main queries, displaying the top amount of  players with the best score (e.g. top 10, top 5 etc.), listing top players by win rate in a specified number of games (e.g. players who've gotten the most wins in the past 10 matches) and any other specified ranges.
